// You'll learn about the "Web Audio API" and how to use it to play songs. 
// All modern browsers support it, which lets you generate and process audio in web applications.

// This will create a new HTML5 audio element.
const audio = new Audio();

//To keep track of the songs, the current song playing, and the time of the current song.
let userData = {
    songs: [...allSongs],
};

// Since users will be able to shuffle and delete songs from the playlist.
// You will need to create a copy of the allSongs array without mutating the original.
// This is where the spread operator (...) comes in handy.
// It allows you to copy all elements from one array into another.
// It can also be used to concatenate multiple arrays into one.
